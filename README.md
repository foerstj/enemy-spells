This mod does not require LoA, but is compatible with it.

To install, put the Enemy Spells.dsres in your Resources or DSLOA folder.

## Balancing

Attack damage, mana cost & gold price are roughly in line with original attack spells.

Required level is a bit higher than the typical encounter level of the respective enemy. The spells progress for 20 levels.
