# enemy-spells

Adding variants of enemy spells for the player to use.

Spells:
- "Frost Shot" (spell of the Braak Mage) for NM level 20
- "Arc" (spell of the Dark Caster) for NM level 32
- "Spiral Freeze" (spell of the Swamp Witch) for NM level 40

## Installation

This mod does not require LoA, but is compatible with it.

To install, put the Enemy Spells.dsres in your Resources or DSLOA folder.

## Balancing

Attack damage, mana cost & gold price are roughly in line with original attack spells.

Required level is a bit higher than the typical encounter level of the respective enemy. The spells progress for 20 levels.

## Attribution

The names of the spells are taken from the Sybex Guide.
